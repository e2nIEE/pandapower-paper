# Case study for Paper on pandapower

This repository includes an exemplary case study that demonstrates the capabilities of pandapower.
The case study is used in a reference paper for pandapower (to be published)

The case study consists of three parts:
1. Definition of a 10kV ring main grid in radial operation (grid.ipynb)
2. Analysis of all possible switching states in the grid to analyse feasible switch positions considering radiality and short-circuit constraints (switch_evaluation.ipynb)
3. Time series simulation for one day optimising switching states considering active power losses, line loading, transformer loading and voltage constraints (time_series_simulation.ipynb)

The case study works with pandapower 1.4.3.
